# V1
- [X] Make kibana-init-job managed by Helm and deletable
- [X] Replicate secrets in monitoring namespace
- [X] Add monitoring resources
- [X] `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "grafana-dashboards-def" : configmap "grafana-dashboards-def" not found`
- [ ] Configure values.schema.json

# V2
- [ ] helm test
    - [ ] HTTP endpoints are curl'able
- [ ] Investigate monitoring subchart instead of being installed with everything so that we don't need to manage namespace. Goal would be, if monitoring is wanted, `helm install nemesis-monitoring-release nemesis-monitoring -n monitoring`
- [ ] dotnet-deployment - Add data hosting provider values based on if .Values.aws or .Values.minio. Might need code changes
- [ ] Mimic validate_aws_resources
- [ ] RabbitMq connection string as a configuration. Can this be dynamically built so we can use a generated password?
